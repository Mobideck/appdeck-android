/**
 * A pool of HTTP connections. This class exposes its tuning parameters as
 * system properties:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code http.keepAlive} true if HTTP connections should be pooled at
 *       all. Default is true.
 *   <li>{@code http.maxConnections} maximum number of connections to each URI.
 *       Default is 5.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This class <i>doesn't</i> adjust its configuration as system properties
 * are changed. This assumes that the applications that set these parameters do
 * so before making HTTP connections, and that this class is initialized lazily.
